**What did you study in college?**

I had a major in Classical Studies (with honors) and a minor in Statistics. The "honors" means I wrote [a lengthy research paper](/2016/12/19/clst-honors-abstract-intro.html) about bad Christians reading a bad translation of Plato in Roman Egypt.

**What did you actually study?**    
* Languages: Ancient Greek (Attic & Homeric), some Latin, a lot of R.
* Reading: ancient texts, histories, mathematical proofs. 
* Writing: short essays (3-5 pages), longer research papers (12-18 pages), 
independent projects for statistics courses. Plus: some very unrelated classes, 
the best of which was intermediate astrophysics.    

**What have you done since college?**  
* Summer 2017: Graduated, a bit of travel, moved back to Philly with one suitcase.
* Fall 2017: Worked operations and event-planning at a social-justice synagogue
in West Philly. Handshake work around the theatre community. Read novels, 
secondhand bike, weekly CSA.
* Jan 2018â€“now: No. 7(?) @ Fishtown Analytics, now [dbt Labs](https://www.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/about-us/). I'm a "Product Manager" (whatever that means), working on [a little piece of open-source software](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core), trying to keep the music playing.
* Aug 2021: Moved to Marseille, France.

**Tell me about some of your other interests.**  

I love theatre, enough to love it even when I hate it. Malheureusement, I haven't been doing much since moving to France, sauf the act of my everyday existence.

I spend a lot of time reading, sometimes the right things. I quite like [n+1](https://www.nplusonemag.com/) and [Jewish Currents](https://jewishcurrents.org/).

**Have you read...?**

Maybe!

**What else should we talk about?**

Politics, religion, language, climate crisis, poetry

**Where do you see yourself in x year(s)?**  

Je ne sais pas !
