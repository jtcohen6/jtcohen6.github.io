**What did you study in college?**

I had a major in Classical Studies (honors) and a minor in Statistics (Wharton). The "honors" means I wrote [a lengthy research paper](/2016/12/19/clst-honors-abstract-intro.html) about bad Christians reading a bad translation of Plato in Roman Egypt. That my minor is from Wharton means that my classes were in a different building and, on average, [taught by better-paid faculty](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/03/28/study-finds-continued-large-gaps-faculty-salaries-based-discipline).

**What did you actually study?**    
* Languages: Attic Greek, Latin, R.
* Reading: ancient texts, histories, mathematical proofs. 
* Writing: short essays (3-5 pages), longer research papers (12-18 pages), 
independent projects for statistics courses. Plus: some very unrelated classes, 
the best of which was intermediate astrophysics.    

**What have you done since college?**  
* Summer 2017: Graduated, travelled, signed a lease.
* Fall 2017: Worked operations and event-planning at a social-justice synagogue
in West Philly. Handshake work around the theatre community. Read novels, 
secondhand bike, weekly CSA.
* Jan 2018â€“now: No. 6 @ [Fishtown Analytics](https://www.fishtownanalytics.com/).
Open-source software, Medium data, the future of analytics at all the
startups you've heard of (and especially the ones you haven't).

**Tell me about some of your other interests.**  

I love theatre, enough to love it even when I hate it.    
* 2017: [*The Merchant of Venice*](/things/merchant-overview.pdf) (dir.), [*Long Day's Journey Into Night*](http://www.quintessencetheatre.org/long-days-journey) (Quintessence, asst. dir.), [On the Rocks Fringe '17](https://www.ontherocksphilly.com/copy-of-birdie-s-pit-stop) (lights).
* 2018: Collaborative projects including [*Potts / Table on Table on Table*](https://www.broadstreetreview.com/theater/solow-fest-2018-greenfield-collectives-potts-with-table-on-table-on-table) (SoLow / Greenfield Collective), [*CHEZ VOUS*](https://fringearts.com/event/chez-vous/) (Fringe '18), [*Immigrant Kitchen*](https://www.shreshthkhilani.com/projects/immigrant-kitchen/) (SoLow / Leeway).

I spend a lot of time reading, especially [Jia](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jia-tolentino).

**Where do you see yourself in x year(s)?**  

I've only ever had permanent residence on the East Coast of the United States, 
but I'm an at-will employee of life and all conditions are subject to change 
without advance notice or approval. The world may not be around for very much
longer, and I am open to grand gestures on behalf of the people in it.

Yes. This site (such as it is) is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
