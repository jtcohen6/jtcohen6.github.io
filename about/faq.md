**What did you study in college?**

I had a major in Classical Studies (with honors) and a minor in Statistics. The "honors" means I wrote [a lengthy research paper](/2016/12/19/clst-honors-abstract-intro.html) about bad Christians reading a bad translation of Plato in Roman Egypt.

**What did you actually study?**    
* Languages: Ancient Greek (Attic & Homeric), some Latin, a lot of R.
* Reading: ancient texts, histories, mathematical proofs. 
* Writing: short essays (3-5 pages), longer research papers (12-18 pages), 
independent projects for statistics courses. Plus: some very unrelated classes, 
the best of which was intermediate astrophysics.    

**What have you done since college?**  
* Summer 2017: Graduated, a bit of travel, moved back to Philly with one suitcase.
* Fall 2017: Worked operations and event-planning at a social-justice synagogue
in West Philly. Handshake work around the theatre community. Read novels, 
secondhand bike, weekly CSA.
* Jan 2018â€“now: No. 5 @ [Fishtown Analytics](https://www.fishtownanalytics.com/).
Open-source software, Medium data, the future of analytics. 
I work on [dbt](https://getdbt.com), heard of it?

**Tell me about some of your other interests.**  

I love theatre, enough to love it even when I hate it.    
* 2017: [*The Merchant of Venice*](/things/merchant-overview.pdf) (dir.), [*Long Day's Journey Into Night*](http://www.quintessencetheatre.org/long-days-journey) (Quintessence, asst. dir.), [On the Rocks Fringe '17](https://www.ontherocksphilly.com/) (lights).
* 2018: Collaborative projects including [*Potts / Table on Table on Table*](https://www.broadstreetreview.com/theater/solow-fest-2018-greenfield-collectives-potts-with-table-on-table-on-table) (SoLow / Greenfield Collective), [*CHEZ VOUS*](https://fringearts.com/event/chez-vous/) (Fringe '18), [*Immigrant Kitchen*](https://www.shreshthkhilani.com/projects/immigrant-kitchen/) (SoLow / Leeway).
* 2019: Opera Delaware (I died on stage), Fringe '19 (lights).
* 2020: Well.

I've lived my entire adult life (seven years) in the greatest city in the world.
Since Krasner '17, I've done my small part to ensure that [the left keeps winning in Philly](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/philadelphia-dem-primary-movement/).

I spend a lot of time reading, sometimes the right things.

**Where do you see yourself in x year(s)?**  

I'm moving to France, as soon as they'll have me.
