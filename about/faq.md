**What did you study in college?**  
I had a major (with honors!) in Classical Studies and a minor (from Wharton!) in Statistics. The "honors" means I wrote [a lengthy research paper](/2016/12/19/clst-honors-abstract-intro.html) about bad Christians reading a bad translation of Plato in Roman Egypt. That my minor is from Wharton just means that my classes were in a different building and, on average, [taught by better-paid faculty](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/03/28/study-finds-continued-large-gaps-faculty-salaries-based-discipline).

**What did you actually study?**  
Languages: a lot of Greek (Attic), some Latin, and a lot of R. Reading: ancient texts, histories,  mathematical proofs. Writing: short essays (3-5 pages), longer research papers (12-18 pages), some independent projects for statistics courses. I also took some very unrelated classes, the best of which was intermediate astrophysics.

**What do you plan to do with that?**  
There are very good reasons for pursuing a liberal arts degree (see: hiring [trends](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2015/07/29/liberal-arts-degree-tech/&refURL=&referrer=#73094ba5745d.), employer [surveys](https://www.aacu.org/leap/presidentstrust/compact/2013SurveySummary), our [Automated Future (TM)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-02-18/mark-cuban-sees-greater-demand-for-liberal-arts-majors), personal [fulfilment](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/opinion/dont-turn-away-from-the-art-of-life.html)). At the same time, I recognize that the choice also means a comparatively lower starting salary and less vocational certainty.

Contrary to expectations, I'm quite employable, in some ways I can control and in [others I can only acknowledge](http://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/w9873.html). I developed a lot of event-planning, communications, and organization-development skills through my college extracurriculars, on par with experiences at many entry- or mid-level positions. I spent June and July of 2016 as an intern in the Aladdin Client Services division of BlackRock, after winning a prize for [use of an Aladdin API at the PennApps XIII](https://devpost.com/software/emerging-markets-in-the-news-2006-2016) hackathon the previous January.

At this point, I would like to be involved in an industry I find meaningful or with an organization whose mission I admire. Right now, that looks like the arts, local government, journalism, and the non-profit sector.

**Tell me about some of your other interests.**  
I love theatre, enough to love it even when I hate it. I spent four years on the board of iNtuitons, an "experimental" student theatre group at Penn. I also found my way into government as Chair of the Student Activities Council and confusingly exclusive clubs (Philomathean Society, Sphinx Senior Society) where, honestly, what I signed up for and what I got out of it were very different things.

I try to read a lot, with an aspiration toward longer-form journalism, and I'll read anything with Nathan Heller, Jia Tolentino, Adam Gopnik, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Maggie Haberman, or David Farenthold in the byline (in no particular order). Most recently, I've been reading a number of UX/UI blogs and coming to realize that (for all my qualms about [freelancing](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/05/15/is-the-gig-economy-working), [the tech industry](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/), [pop psychology](https://uxdesign.cc/ux-psychology-go-hand-in-hand-how-gestalt-theory-appears-in-ux-design-18b727343da8)) it's a practice I find interesting. I believe in the value of things like user research, font choices, and front-end web development, but these are skills I have only informally and I shrink at using the word "designer.""

**What are you doing right now?**  
At this very moment, I'm writing an FAQ section on my personal website because...  
I work part-time as an operations & events coordinator at [Kol Tzedek](http://www.kol-tzedek.org/), a Reconstructionist synagogue in West Philly, and remotely on various technical projects for the [Society for Classical Studies](https://classicalstudies.org/) I spend a lot of time reading and thinking about writing.

**Where do you see yourself in five years?**  
I wish I could give an answer that dignifies the seriousness of the question. As it is, I don't pretend to know what my life looks like five months from now, let alone five years. I've only ever had permanent residence on the East Coast of the United States, but all conditions are subject to change without advance notice or approval.
