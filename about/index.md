I'm a recent Penn graduate, with a B.A. in Classical Studies (College major) and Statistics (Wharton minor). I spent a lot of my time on campus with iNtuitons Experimental Theatre, the Student Activities Council, the Philomathean Society, Sphinx Senior Society, and the Penn Humanities Forum. I also spent the past few months directing *The Merchant of Venice* for Front Row Theatre Co., with performances in April.

I am interested in most things, but the list probably begins with performing arts, cultural heritage, public education, the future of journalism, and open-access data.

The best way to reach me is by email: **jerco** at **sas** dot **upenn** dot **edu**.

Until then,<br>
Jeremy
