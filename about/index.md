Salve!

I'm a fourth-year student at Penn studying Classics and Statistics. My primary group on campus was [iNtuitons Experimental Theatre](http://www.intuitons.org), of which I was recently  Chair, and I just finished directing *The Merchant of Venice* for Front Row Theatre Co. in April 2017. I've also been involved with the Student Activities Council, the Philomathean Society, Sphinx Senior Society, and the Penn Humanities Forum.

You can use the [contact form](/contact/) to reach out -- messages go straight to my email inbox, and I like to think that I write good emails.

Until then,<br>
Jeremy
