**Believer:** scientific method, climate change, open data, thought experiments, nonprofit theatre.  
**Skeptic:** gig economy, black boxes, P-hacking, zero-sum games.

I spent a lot of the last four years with iNtuitons Experimental Theatre, the Student Activities Council, the Philomathan Society, Sphinx Senior Society, and the Penn Humanities Forum. I also spent the past few months directing *The Merchant of Venice* for Front Row Theatre Co., with performances on April 6-8.

The best way to reach me is by email: **jerco** at **sas** dot **upenn** dot **edu**.
