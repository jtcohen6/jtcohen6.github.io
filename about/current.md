What I'm up to in the months of September and October:
* event coordination at **[Kol Tzedek](http://www.kol-tzedek.org/)**, a synagogue in West Philly
* Assistant Director of *Long Day's Journey into Night* at **[Quintessance Theatre Group](http://www.quintessencetheatre.org/)**, a "progressive, classic, repertory, ensemble theatre" in Mt. Airy
* lighting design for **[On the Rocks' 2017 Fringe show](http://fringearts.com/event/grooms-fag-brides-cunt-best-mans-whore-maiden-honor-just-hung-closet/)** (BSR [review](http://www.broadstreetreview.com/theater/philly-fringe-2017-on-the-rocks-the-grooms-a-fag))

& all year round:
* working on miscellaneous special projects for the **[Society for Classical Studies](https://classicalstudies.org/)**
* trying to learn French so that I can someday speak to [this person's](https://twitter.com/frenchplum) mother

I'm most free on Mondays.
