Here, you can find links to my various projects -- most decidedly (and unsurprisingly) *in-progress*.

<h4><a href="https://jtcohen6.github.io/greco-roman-authors/">Greco-Roman Authors</a></h4>
Interactive map and "data" visualization for the literature of classical antiquity. This was a project completed under the supervision of Prof. James Ker for the Penn Undergrad Research Mentoring program in summer 2016. HTML, JavaScript, SQL. (You can read more about the project background [here](/projects/greco-roman-authors/background).)

<h4><a href="/projects/ranking-us-universities">Ranking American Universities</a></h4>
Final project for a statistics course in "Modern Data Mining". The work was in R, the prettification (pulchrioration?) in HTML. Inspired by a (lengthy) paper Laura and I wrote in fall 2015 on service-learning in higher education.

<h4><a href="http://devpost.com/software/emerging-markets-in-the-news-2006-2016">Emerging Markets in the News, 2006-2016</a></h4>
Project for PennApps XIII, as a partnership with [Raghav Joshi](https://raghavjoshi.firebaseapp.com/) with technical assistance from [Gus Wynn](http://guswynn.github.io/).

Most of what I do is nonfiction writing. I've uploaded two samples ([here](/2015/09/07/review-becoming-penn.html) and [here](/2015/10/26/versatile-virgil.html)), representing different styles and subject matter.
