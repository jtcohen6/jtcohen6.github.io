## Overview

An ongoing attempt to map, simply and intuitively, the births, deaths, and travels of major Greek and Latin authors. At its heart, a proposal: approaching the ancient world's writers visually, geographically, and always in relation. A more theoretical background is available [here](/projects/greco-roman-authors/background.html).

## How to Use

Run the [**interactive map**](/projects/greco-roman-authors/interactive-map.html) in a web browser and go crazy.

Support for mobile (and most non-desktop screen sizes, and just about all other functionality) still underway. Consider it proof of concept, for nowâ€”or about enough to impress my mom.

If you have suggestions, I'd love to hear them! Contact via GitHub, Twitter, or this website's [contact form](https://jtcohen6.github.io/contact/).
