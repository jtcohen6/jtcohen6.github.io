I've been hanging lights for six years, and designing for almost as long.

My aesthetic is heavily influenced by space and context. After lighting shows conventional and unconventional, and working in venues both established and (literally) underground, I find that I prefer the work of finding, shaping, and creating space more compelling than mastery at Vectorworks.

#### From Fringe 2017:

> "Julia Montante's scenic design and Jeremy T. Cohen's lighting use the space (even its three pillars) well, creating a twinkle-light wedding fantasia that contrasts ironically with the dark tale." - Mark Cofta, [Broad Street Review](http://www.broadstreetreview.com/theater/philly-fringe-2017-on-the-rocks-the-grooms-a-fag)

> "Jeremy T. Cohanâ€™s [sp!] guerrilla lighting is very much of a piece with the world Walker and Di Monaco are creating." - Cameron Kelsall, [phindie](http://phindie.com/15897-the-grooms-a-fag-the-brides-a-cunt-on-the-rocks-2017-fringe-review/)


#### Groups I've worked with:

* **Penn:** iNtuitons Experimental Theatre, Front Row Theatre Co., Quadramics Theatre Co., Naatak Global Contemporary Theatre, African American Arts Alliance, Theatre Arts Department, Penn Ballet, PennYo Chinese A Capella
* **Professional:** Quintessence Theatre Co., On the Rocks, Philly Young Playwrights

#### Spaces I've worked in:

* Church basement, feat. two working outlets and knob dimmers
* Friends' basement with, like, no working outlets
* Multipurpose room in student union in 3/4 thrust
* Performing arts fabrication workshop, converted for the week into Mark Rothko's studio
* Antique (ca. 1928) Mt. Airy movie theatre grand lobby
* Penn Museum, including Chinese rotunda & Egyptian room

Unfortunately, I don't have good-quality photographs from many of the smaller groups and productions.
