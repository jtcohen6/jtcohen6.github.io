While my company's software is open-source, the work I do at work is largely
under client contract. So! I include two final projects from statistical computing 
and econometrics courses. One is the result of original research, the other an 
attempt at replicating the methods and findings of a (particularly ambitious) 
scholarly article. While neither demonstrates my best technical or nonfictional 
writing, both were (statistically) significant endeavors requiring dozens of 
hours in R and nontrivial leaps outside my comfort zone.

#### [Ranking American Universities](stat471final)
Final project for a course in "Modern Data Mining", May 2016. All data collection, collation, and cleaning was my own. Data-science methods included LASSO and decision-tree. Inspired by a (lengthy) paper written in fall 2015 on service-learning in higher education.

#### [Pre-Modern Dutch Urban Development](stat520final)
Final project for first of two-course series in "Applied Econometrics", Dec 2016. Duplication of *Economica* paper by İ. Semih Akçomak, Dinand Webbink and Bas ter Weel (2016), with comments and criticism. Econometric methods included ordinary least-squares and two-stage least squares regression.

#### [Emerging Markets in the News, 2006-2016](https://devpost.com/software/emerging-markets-in-the-news-2006-2016)
Just for fun, I also include a project that my roommate and I completed in a
weekend for PennApps, January 2016. We won drones; I did a summer internship
in New York; the rest is alternate history.
