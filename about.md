I'm a fourth-year student at Penn studying Classics and Statistics. Interests include ancient religion, Attic drama, Roman colonialism, higher education, and the history of baseball. Favorite languages (right now) are Ionian Greek, Dutch, and R.

If you're curious to know more, use the [contact form](/contact/)! Nothing can beat an in-person meeting, but I'd rather you draw conclusions on the basis of my email etiquette, rather than HTML wow-factor.

Until then,<br>
