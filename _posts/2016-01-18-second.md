"Title originality" is a valid critique. Counting higher than three won't be a feature, I promise.

For now, though, it looks like everything is in _(slapdash rudimentary)_ order:

* the pages that should exist do exist---or, at least they lead to other pages that do exist;
* the font is beautiful;
* I'm proud enough to even add a contact form, **inviting** criticism;
* the selfsame contact form also allows visitors to solicit my resume which, per my [first post](/2016/01/13/first.html), satisfies one    potential reason for this website's _(happy &/or miserable)_ existence.

_p.s. The real killer: that first line shows up on the home page. I mean, what a tease(r)!_
