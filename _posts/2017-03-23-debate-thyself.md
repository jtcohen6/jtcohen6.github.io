While waiting for the 6 train, I listened to the [story](http://www.radiolab.org/story/debatable/) of Ryan Walsh. Against all
odds—and there were many—he and his partner, queer black students at
Emporia State University in Kansas, won the national collegiate debate
tournament in 2013. After reading the [11-page ballot](http://www.cedadebate.org/forum/index.php?topic=4762.0) of Scott Harris,
deciding vote of the tournament’s final round, I cried.

Then, I saw the backlash: conservative voices in the greater debate
community, contesting the legitimacy of contenders who speak
“gibberish.” As Jessica Carew Kraft [wrote in *The Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/04/traditional-college-debate-white-privilege/360746/),
teams feel the hard work of policy debate preparation is “frustrated”,
and the pedagogical goals of the activity “undermined.” Critics from
outside the community see what they want: inclusive progress at last in
the most elite extracurricular; affirmative action and political
correctness run riot; or [tensions](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/30/the-new-activism-of-liberal-arts-colleges), however thinly veiled, between
institutions and the diverse populations they admit only at arm’s length.

I participated in Public Forum Debate, an event more accessible than
policy, for four years in high school. We spoke more slowly, researched
less heavily, with non-expert judges and a resolution topic that changed
month-to-month instead of keeping one for the year. If policy debate was
meant to prepare future lawyers, government officials, and
private-sector stakeholders, the conceit of PFD was pure participatory
democracy.

Even with that noble mission, Scott Harris’ ballot was not the first to
bring tears to my eyes. Once, in the late rounds of Harvard’s national
high-school tournament, we lost two-one on a question about abolishing
birthright citizenship. The other team made its winning case on the
backs of a permanent second class of non-citizen workers. They argued
that poor immigrants were better off as slaves in the U.S. than free in
Nicaragua—slaves because they would, under a skewed reading of the
14^th^ Amendment, pass down unfreedom to their children—and that the
nation overall was better off for having their labor. One judge said we
lost on impacts, never having proved that the arc of a moral universe
ought to outweigh ramped-up economic output. Another said simply that we
lost on a tightly argued framework to prefer U.S. citizens, or “America
First.” (This was 2012.) I felt for hours after that I had somehow
failed the undocumented children of this country, not to mention the
[65,000 high-school graduates each year who lack citizenship](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/ed/15/08/what-about-dreamers). At the time, I didn’t even know any, from my lily-white Massachusetts suburb.
The one judge in our favor refused the other team’s arguments on moral
grounds, an act of unilateral juror nullification.

I wonder what sort of ballot Scott Harris would have written. He offered
pages of precise consideration of frameworks, links, impacts; he
regarded precedent with a wary eye; yet what he offered, eventually, was
an appeal to the shared humanity of a community that can be a home.

In my four years at an Ivy League university, I met more former debaters
than I can count. Looking back, I remember that my high-school debate
team had a chip on its shoulder because we had no money and no formal
coach. Despite being a very good public school in the suburbs of Boston,
with great teachers and a beautiful new football field, we did not have
and could not hire someone like Scott Harris. We had no one to spend
every weekend driving vans like Scott Harris, to eat terrible food in
break rooms like Scott Harris, to sleep in terrible motel rooms
two-to-a-double-bed like Scott Harris, to write ballots like Scott
Harris. The fact is that no one has written a ballot like Scott Harris.
They’re usually too short, [sometimes worse](https://badballotblog.wordpress.com/).

The fact is that the debate classroom does not and never did exist apart
from the world at large. The fact is that metadebate, to paraphrase a
German philosopher, is everything that is the case. The fact is that my
partner and I were male-, cis-, straight-presenting, a Chinese-American
student good at asking questions without seeming aggressive and a
Jewish-American student good at cracking jokes, at tossing out
opponents’ arguments with more intuition and charisma and less
speed-read evidence. We were self-taught in a debate world that, while
hard and political and socioeconomically problematic, we could call our
home on day one. Yet, after walking across the campus of an elite school
and seeing familiar faces, we still thought *we* were the outsiders.

I admire, respect, and look up to Ryan Walsh after he won the National
Debate Tournament. I guess that’s part of the point. I wonder if I’d
have the same admiration if he’d lost, if he’d dropped in semis, if he’s
never made it to the tournament. I guess that’s part of it, too.
