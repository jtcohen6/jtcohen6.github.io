Why was an Egyptian-language fragment of Plato's *Republic* buried in a jar, in the middle of the desert, five hundred miles south of Alexandria? [(Full text PDF.)](/media/clst_honors.pdf)

### Abstract

The discovery, at Nag Hammadi in 1945, of a sealed jar filled with
religious manuscripts reinvigorated the study of Gnosticism. One of the
more confounding elements, found within the sixth codex, is a
Coptic-language excerpt of the ninth book of Plato’s *Republic.*
Building upon previous scholarship, this paper will contend that the
excerpt was included as a necessary reference for understanding the
seventh logion of *The Gospel of Thomas*, a non-canonical early
Christian wisdom-text. Plato *Rep.* IX 588a-589b relates a parable that
solves this difficult saying of the risen Jesus. When, in the 4<sup>th</sup>
century, an audience member could not be guaranteed a background in
classical Greek philosophy, the Coptic excerpt of *Rep.* IX could fill
in the gap. It is not a perfect translation, however, with shifted
emphasis and tone. This study’s additional goal is to demonstrate that
this shift is explicable within the history of Roman Egypt, and
analogous to broader changes in Christian hermeneutics and canonicity
between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> centuries.

### Introduction

Books XIII and IX of Plato’s *Republic* are concerned chiefly with the
decline of his ideal city from injustice, mirroring the rising action of
books II through IV.[^1] The Nag Hammadi Codex (NHC) VI excerpt begins
right when (588a) Plato’s dialectical figure Socrates has just finished
evaluating different forms of governance and reprises the motivating
question first raised in Book II: Is it more profitable for a man to be
thoroughly just, unjust, or to do unjust things while appearing just to
his peers? As answer and also summary, he presents a parable of man as a
soul in three parts: the many-headed beast (appetitive), the lion
(spirited), and the human being (rational).

“Fashioning an image of the soul in words” (<span lang="el">εἰκόνα πλάσαντες τῆς ψυχῆς
λόγῳ</span>)[^2] may not be familiar to a modern reader, nor might this moment
of the ninth book seem a crucial turning-point in the dialogue. The
motif carried weight in ancient metaphysics, though, especially among
the Middle and Neo-Platonists. The tripartite soul, divided passions, or
animal spirits appear to varying degrees in Philo, Alcinous, Plotinus,
Porphyry, Proclus, Eusebius, and Paul. Each one of these thinkers
warrants his own lengthy treatment, and his debt to the broader Platonic
tradition would be a crucial piece. This study’s interest is rather in
*The Gospel of Thomas*, which includes in its seventh logion an apparent
reference to the lion-man Platonic motif.

*The Gospel of Thomas* was a non-canonical Christian tractate and, in
modern times, one of the most influential texts found in Coptic, in its
entirety, near Nag Hammadi, Egypt. *Thomas* does not read like a
canonical Christian gospel. It is structured into clustered sayings
(‘logia’), thus sharing a genre with wisdom-texts of the 2<sup>nd</sup> century,
such as the *Chaldean Oracles* and the *Hermetica.* These works are
contemporaries of *Thomas*, too, as the majority of scholars place its
composition in Greek or Syriac between 40 and 140 AD, the latest being
Porter’s claim at 250 AD.[^3] The *Thomas* sayings are declarations of
the risen savior-figure Jesus, and the stakes of the tractate are
established in its opening invocation: “Whoever finds the meaning of
these sayings will not taste death.” There is much debate, discussed
below at some length, as to why *Thomas* was excluded from the synoptic
canon: Was this a function primarily of its content (world-denying in
places), its emphasis (soteriological instead of historical), or its
style (discursive instead of narrative)? The question is certainly
relevant for scholars of the Early Church, interested in relating
*Thomas* to a proposed sayings-gospel precursor ‘Q’ for Matthew and
Luke. This study’s focal point, however, is in an apparent reference to
the Platonic lion-man motif within the work’s seventh logion:

> Jesus said: Blessed is the lion whom the man shall eat and the lion
> becomes man; but foul is the man whom the lion shall eat and the lion
> shall become man.

The stakes for understanding are high; per the incipit, each *Thomas*
saying has within it the key to eternal salvation. If the *Thomas* logia
are intentionally confounding or obscure, then the seventh would seem
one of the most difficult. Why does the lion become man in both cases,
whether eating or being eaten? The man is cursed when the lion eats him.
Why, if the man eats the lion and humanizes it, does the lion still
receive the blessing? For decades after the Nag Hammadi discovery,
several scholars maintained that the second half of the logion was
corrupted, switching the subject and object to achieve *chiasmus.*[^4]
Without compelling evidence of scribal error, though, the Coptic text
calls for treatment verbatim.

Logion 7 has no obvious parallels with synoptic Christian sources,
unlike those sayings (nearly half of *Thomas*) that do overlap with
dialogue in Luke or Matthew.[^5] Nor does familiarity with the wider
Judeo-Christian milieu solve this puzzle. There is a lion-deity trope
found more generally outside the canonical Christian tradition, in some
Jewish and Gnostic sources. Israel and Yahweh are identified with or
compared to a lion.[^6] Cosmogenic works, such as the *Pistis Sophia*
(discovered in late 18<sup>th</sup> century) and *Apocryphon of John* (NHC II),
imagine the Old Testament demiurge Yaldabaoth to have the face of a lion
(*leontoeides*).[^7] Yet these negative portrayals of the lion as an Old
Testament, devilish, and Earth-bound figure do not agree with the
balanced (if confusing) portrayal in *Thomas* 7. Why would one bless the
Hebrew deity or false creator-demigod for being eaten by man? Working
through these possibilities, Howard M. Jackson shows convincingly that
Plato *Rep.* IX 588a-589b is *the* necessary point of reference for one
wishing to unravel the mystery of *Thomas* 7. If the lion represents the
spirited passion (<span lang="el">θυμοειδές</span>) within a human being, and ‘the man within’
represents his reason (<span lang="el">λογιστικὸν</span>), one can ‘rewrite’ *Thomas* 7 as
follows:

> Jesus said: Blessed (harmonious) is the leonine passion which the
> inner-man reason shall eat, and the passion becomes (subset of) outer
> man; but foul (disharmonious) is the reason which the passion shall
> eat and the passion shall become (ruler over) outer man.

There is now a compelling case to make that the excerpt of Plato in NH
Codex VI is related significantly to the seventh logion of *Thomas* in
NH Codex II. This is an argument advanced by both Jackson (1985) and
Lanzillotta (2013), the two most thorough investigators. Stances taken
by other scholars will receive more discussion below, but their
offerings are not as much alternative hypotheses as healthy skepticism.
Would the 4<sup>th</sup>-century Coptic-writer have known the excerpt to be
Plato? Could they have unknowingly copied down the *Republic* fragment,
thinking it a Hermetic text or just an interesting passage? It is
impossible to disprove these scenarios entirely, but the specificity of
inclusion suggests an intentionality. The excerpt begins with Socrates’
question and ends with the conclusion of the relevant parable, at a
significant moment.[^8] Also, some choices of redaction and shifts of
emphasis, verbal mood, and interrogative syntax can be linked to
purposive work—perhaps a ‘gnosticizing’ agenda of the translator, but
almost certainly not idle commonplace copying. It is also worth
remembering the expense of papyrus, the immense time and effort of
scribal work. On these bases, this paper proceeds from the premise that
the *Republic* excerpt’s inclusion was not an accident or coincidence.

This paper’s second major argument, and its departure from previous
scholarship, requires firm grounding in the historical playing-field. As
mentioned above, the evidence and scholarly consensus put *Thomas’*
original composition in Greek or Syriac between 40 and 140 AD, and
certainly no later than 250. The full version of *Thomas* available to
modern readers is in Coptic, from Nag Hammadi. The entire NH collection
is dated no earlier than the middle of the 4<sup>th</sup> century. The
manuscripts may have been buried after Athanasius, Archbishop of
Alexandria, condemned heretical religious texts in 367,[^9] although
scholars are careful to note that this is “mere speculation.”[^10] This
means that at least one century, and perhaps two or more, separated (1)
the original cluster-composition of *Thomas* and (2) the translation,
revision, and collection of Coptic texts that were eventually buried
near this Pachomian monastery in Upper Egypt.

The geopolitical and socioeconomic differences between 2<sup>nd</sup>-century
Alexandria and 4<sup>th</sup>-century Upper Egypt are considerable. In the larger
empire, E.R. Dodds saw in the Marcus Aurelius’ reign (161-180) the start
of an ‘Age of Anxiety’, a Rome obsessed by peripheral wars and
backward-looking classicism. Speaking broadly about the latter
centuries, so-called ‘Late Antiquity’, Peter Brown saw in the overtaxed
and culturally relegated colonies of Egypt, the Levant, and North Africa
the foment of Christianity. During and after the reign of Augustus,
Naphtali Lewis describes, Roman Egypt was under the direct command of
the emperor’s personal representative. It was a codified apartheid
state, where “the touchstone of status was Hellenism”, with top-down
legal designations accompanying ethnic ones: Roman citizens ranking
above Jews and Greek dwellers of the major cities, and they in turn
above ‘Egyptians’ (all others). Caste mobility was nearly impossible,
and while “the lot of the humble and the poor was not enviable anywhere
in the Roman Empire… the population of Egypt appears to have been
singled out for exceptionally harsh treatment.”[^11] Even the
enfranchisement in 212 AD of all inhabitants as Roman citizens did
little to change the social structure and class stratifications, which
remained *de facto* if not *de jure*. The privileged position of
educated, literate, and urban Greeks was enforced by law and then by
norm, and the claim to the Hellenistic purisms of the Second Sophistic
was as strong in Alexandria as in Athens. The separateness of
Egyptian-speakers in southern country towns was enforced, even as such
villages would become strong bases of support for Christian traditions,
canonical and otherwise.

Having postulated that the Platonic motif contained in Book IX of the
*Republic* is crucial to understanding *Thomas* 7, it bears
acknowledging that the Nag Hammadi corpus is only one static window onto
a dynamic entity. Why is there a Coptic translation of these religious
tractates, and the *Republic* excerpt in particular? Why does the
excerpt begin and end in such (philosophically) precise moments? There
is a story in the background: Greek-language works, those of the
relatively privileged, had to be rendered comprehensible for
Egyptian-speakers, outside the well-educated urban sphere. The first
version of *Thomas* likely originated in a Hellenized population of the
Levant—Meyer’s best guess is Edessa, Syria[^12]—and circulated in
Greek-speaking cultural hubs like Alexandria. Some Greek fragments of
*Thomas* were found at Oxyrhynchus, in Middle Egypt, 260 miles south.
The full Coptic version comes from Nag Hammadi, another 240 miles along
the Nile and, in many respects, another world entirely.

This difference in milieu between original tractate composition and the
NHC version goes relatively unmentioned in the scholarship, by Jackson
and especially by Lanzillotta. Jackson assumes that the Plato
translator, contributing to the Nag Hammadi corpus, must very well have
been from the same ‘school’ as the original *Thomas* writers, since
there is an undeniable relationship. Lanzillotta’s aim is the
application of intertextual theory, de-emphasizing historical and social
background (at best speculative) in favor of the words on the page. For
him, *Thomas* and Plato exist in a flat universe, with a linear
transformation between them. His conclusion is that *Thomas,* in its
‘gnosticizing’ zeal, insufficiently appreciates the philosophical
intricacy of the *Republic*. This paper’s alternative proposal is to
draw the following contrast:

The original readers of *The Gospel of Thomas* were classically-educated
speakers of Greek in Egypt (or Syriac in the Levant), fluent in
Hellenistic philosophy (including the lion-man motif) and embracing a
multifaceted appreciation for its seventh logion. This first group would
not require a Coptic translation of a Platonic commonplace. Instead, the
Coptic *Republic* fragment makes sense for a second audience:
semi-literate readers and hearers in 4<sup>th</sup>-century Upper Egypt, *de
facto* excluded from the wealth, learning, and Hellenism of the Roman
Near East. For them, perhaps practicing semi-canonical Christianity, the
codices of Nag Hammadi could be an anthologized compendium of apocryphal
knowledge, delivered as oral ministry.

What is the implication of this distinction? The third thrust of the
paper includes an analogy to the hermeneutical divergence between Origen
and Augustine: various versus linear, multifaceted versus
straightforward, textual versus rhetorical, literary versus liturgical.
In the first case, if *The Gospel of Thomas* existed within a broad
Greco-Christian philosophical frame and was read by hermeneutical
circles of 2<sup>nd</sup>- and 3<sup>rd</sup>-century Alexandrians not unlike those of
Philo and Origen, Plato can be allegorized into *Thomas* 7 with layers
of literal, metaphorical, and spiritual meaning. In the second case, if
*Thomas* existed as apocryphal scripture for a semi-heretical,
quasi-Christian movement of semi-literate persons, then the *Rep.* IX
motif existed necessarily and sufficiently as a precise allegorical
tool. The goal was linear progression, from fixed words to final
revelation: ‘Apply directly to logion 7.’ This second interpretive frame
is analogous to (and contemporaneous with) Augustine’s method in the
4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> centuries, whereby an all-encompassing and omniscient
Word solves itself by moving from ‘signs’ to ‘things’. Perhaps working
from the notes of his forebears several generations earlier, the
translator-redactor of Coptic Plato considered the *Republic* excerpt a
necessary reference—a semiotic ‘thing’—in the quest for Gnostic
salvation. Neither Origen nor Augustine endorsed a Gnostic agenda or
*The Gospel of Thomas*, but they offer a useful comparative basis when
thinking about biblical hermeneutics writ large.

Section 2 of this paper offers an answer to the first question: What has
been said convincingly in previous scholarship about the Platonic motif,
the *Gospel of Thomas,* and the nature of their relationship? Section 3
critiques that scholarship and provides social-historical grounding in
Roman Upper Egypt, working toward a deeper explanation for the Coptic
translation. Section 4 extends the boundaries of significance to
allegorical practice and canonicity, musing on potential connections and
implications. This three-part, five-act study offers explanatory power
for the ultimate mystery—why *Rep.* IX 588a-589b, why in Coptic, why in
Nag Hammadi?—by distinguishing between the two literary-historical
contexts: (1) 2<sup>nd</sup>-century Greek-readers, with a broad hermeneutical
frame that relies on fluency in Greek philosophy; (2) 4<sup>th</sup>-century
pseudo-Christians, reading or hearing in Coptic, with a hermeneutic that
privileges verbatim truth and linear progression toward revelation.

    general reading, however: “No doubt the lion here represents human
    passions, or more precisely, the lying spirit of evil.” (p. 371). He
    later makes explicit appeal to “Platonic origin”, e.g. for logion 83
    (p. 377).

[^6]: As noted by Jackson, *Lion Becomes Man* (1985), there are several
    such expressions in the Old Testament (p. 13): “He couched, he lay

    is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee” (Num
    24:9). “Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift
    up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of
    the prey, and drink the blood of the slain” (Num 23:24). “For it
    increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest
    thyself marvellous upon me” (Job 10:16). “I reckoned till morning,
    that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to
    night wilt thou make an end of me” (Isa 38:13). “For I will be unto
    Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I,
    even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall
    rescue him” (Hos 5:14). “Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as
    a leopard by the way will I observe them” (Hos 13:7). “They shall
    walk after the Lord: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar,
    then the children shall tremble from the west” (Hos 11:10). “The
    lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord God hath spoken, who
    can but prophesy?” (Amos 3:8). This image is reflected occasionally
    in the New Testament: “And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion
    roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their
    voices.” (Rev 10:3).
